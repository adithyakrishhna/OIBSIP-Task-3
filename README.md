# Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict car prices. The model is built using the scikit-learn library in Python.

## Steps

The following steps are followed in building the ML model:

1. **Import the dataset**
2. **Visualize the dataset**
3. **Split the data into training and testing sets**
4. **Rescale the features**
5. **Build the model**
6. **Evaluate the model**

## Model

The model used in this project is a linear regression model. Linear regression is a simple but effective model that can be used to predict continuous values.

## Results

The model was evaluated using the R-squared metric. The R-squared value on the test set was 0.85, which indicates that the model is able to explain 85% of the variance in the price of the cars.

## Conclusion

The results of this project show that it is possible to build a machine learning model to predict car prices. The model developed in this project can be used to make predictions about the price of a car given its features.
